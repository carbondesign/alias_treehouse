        </talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>
            Well, if there's anything my generation know it to start with a strong foundation and structure.
        </talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>
            It better be or I ain't getting in it! How do we figure out to build a foundation.
        </talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>
            Well if there's anything your generation knows it's how to Google. Get to it girl, time to fall down the gopher hole!

            Ok, it says here to start a base and frame. Clearly define the outer structure and then begin to build the rooms inside the tree house, making sure to name them so you don't forget and mix up the bathroom and the living room. [Scratches head] There's
            a bathroom?
        </talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>
            Got it! I'll start over here why don't you give it try on your lap top.
        </talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>
            What!? You want me to build a tree house in my laptop?!
        </talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>
            Girl! People with clean fingernails are wrong! Give it a try or your not invited to my tree party!
        </talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>
            [mumbling] Who want's to go to a tree party anyway.

        These are HTML tags. They are building blocks of HTML. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The main one is the <pre>{{html}}</pre>. You will notice each tag has a beginning and an end. Be careful to keep track of. Start an HTML page by
        typing this in the editor.

    	<talkbubble>Well done grasshopper. Congratulations. You have written your first line of code.</talkbubble>
    	<talkbubble>There are some things in coding that are import to add but not really import for you to know an exact definiton of. One of those things is the DOC Type. Your only job is to remember to add it. There is too much to learn to worry about all the jabberwock</talkbubble>

        Next, we need to add a head, because everyone needs a head don't they? In HTML the head contains all the hidden parts that make the HTML do what it does. Just like the attic in your house hides the ducts and wires that make your house work, the header
        are things you won't see on the page but help the page look and act the way it does. Add the following inside the HTML tag.

    <comicpanel class="col-lg-6 h_6x p_B-2x">
        <talkbubble>That's right. Now, what's a head without a body? That's it! Now, we are ready to add some divs.</talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>Div...that's a funny word.</talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>It's just short hand for "document division". Simply an element that contains content or elements on four sides, starts on a new line and typically takes up the full width available.</talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>So it's a box?</talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>Yes, it's a box. </talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>But! Lets add another box inside of it, and another. [Add 16 divs inside the main div] Well that won't do! Won't do at all. Those aren't very useful boxes! Lets change the shapes, give them height and width and move them around. </talkbubble>
        <talkbubble>To change the shape, color, size or position of a div we must change it with CSS</talkbubble>
