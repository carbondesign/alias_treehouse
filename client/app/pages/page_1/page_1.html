			Ok, how about "Charles" then?  Is it always this hot and boring in Savannah Charles? I normally spend the summer at home in New York with my friend but my grades weren't that great so my mom sent me here to stay with my grandpop.

			Alika, if there's three things I've learned in life it's that "Don't ever wait for someone to teach you nothin'." You have more learning in that laptop than you will ever need. And 2.) If you have an idea of something, learn how to do it yourself." Most folks think that their ideas are as valuable as gold and go around dropping them like silent, stinkers. It's just hot air! Real ain't real till it's real and no one going to help you make your stinkers real.
